## üöÄ Building and Serving Locally

The `mkdocs serve` command builds and serves a local version of your MkDocs documentation, ideal for development and testing:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

- #### Command Breakdown:

    - `mkdocs` is the main MkDocs command-line interface.
    - `serve` is the subcommand to build and locally serve your documentation.

- üßê Note:

    - Grasp changes to the docs in real-time as `mkdocs serve` supports live reloading.
    - To stop the local server, press `CTRL+C`.

## üåç Building and Serving Multi-Language

Supporting multi-language documentation? Follow these steps:

1. Stage all new language \*.md files with Git:

    ```bash
    git add docs/**/*.md -f
    ```

2. Build all languages to the `/site` folder, ensuring relevant root-level files are present:

    ```bash
    # Clear existing /site directory
    rm -rf site

    # Loop through each language config file and build
    mkdocs build -f docs/mkdocs.yml
    for file in docs/mkdocs_*.yml; do
      echo "Building MkDocs site with $file"
      mkdocs build -f "$file"
    done
    ```

3. To preview your site, initiate a simple HTTP server:

    ```bash
    cd site
    python -m http.server
    # Open in your preferred browser
    ```

- üñ•Ô∏è Access the live site at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üì§ Deploying Your Documentation Site

- Configure `mkdocs.yml` with deployment settings.
- Use `mkdocs deploy` to build and deploy your site.

* ### GitHub Pages Deployment Example:

    ```bash
    mkdocs gh-deploy
    ```
