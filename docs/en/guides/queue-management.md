## FAQ

### How can I use SFDT_Ibrahim YOLO11 for real-time queue management?

To use SFDT_Ibrahim YOLO11 for real-time queue management, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the YOLO11 model with `YOLO("yolo11n.pt")`.
2. Capture the video feed using `cv2.VideoCapture`.
3. Define the region of interest (ROI) for queue management.
4. Process frames to detect objects and manage queues.

Here's a minimal example:

```python
import cv2

from sfdt_ibrahim import solutions

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video.mp4")
queue_region = [(20, 400), (1080, 400), (1080, 360), (20, 360)]

queue = solutions.QueueManager(
    model="yolo11n.pt",
    region=queue_region,
    line_width=3,
)

while cap.isOpened():
    success, im0 = cap.read()
    if success:
        out = queue.process_queue(im0)
        cv2.imshow("Queue Management", im0)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
            break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
