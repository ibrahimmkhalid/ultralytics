# SFDT_Ibrahim HUB Integrations

Learn about [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) integrations with various platforms and formats.

## Datasets

Seamlessly import your datasets in [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) for [model training](./models.md#train-model).

After a dataset is imported in [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub), you can [train a model](./models.md#train-model) on your dataset just like you would using the [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) datasets.

### Roboflow

You can easily filter the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim) datasets on the [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) [Datasets](https://hub.sfdt_ibrahim.com/datasets) page.

[SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) supports two types of integrations with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim), [Universe](#universe) and [Workspace](#workspace).

#### Universe

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim) Universe integration allows you to import one dataset at a time into [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim).

##### Import

When you export a [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim) dataset, select the [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) format. This action will redirect you to [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub) and trigger the **Dataset Import** dialog.

You can import your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim) dataset by clicking on the **Import** button.

#### Workspace

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim) Workspace integration allows you to import an entire [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=sfdt_ibrahim) Workspace at once into [SFDT_Ibrahim HUB](https://www.sfdt_ibrahim.com/hub).

##### Import

Navigate to the [Integrations](https://hub.sfdt_ibrahim.com/settings?tab=integrations) page by clicking on the **Integrations** button in the sidebar.
